# testrepo
I created the repo on the github website, then cloned it on my linux server.
I then cloned a separate repo with php/html files, moved them to my repo, and git added them.
I then set my git username and email, then committed the added files. Then, I pushed to bitbucket.
I did not follow any tutorials, as I work with command line git every day for work.
